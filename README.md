Welcome to the "Digital Time Capsule" project, demonstrating the introduction of CSS skills I've employed in combination with my foundational HTML understanding. View now to explore the intricate layers of my current digital identity. In a world where online activities shape perceptions and narratives, this project aims to shape the way my digital footprint outlines others' views of myself. Through a meticulously crafted three-page website, I've compiled some of my most interacted with data to narrate my interests and online activity in a way to showcase more about my personality, and personal endeavors. Something I enjoyed of this project is the massive amount of troubleshooting I've done to accomplish the layout and overall look of the site that I've envisioned. Further, I appreciate the essence of the idea being a digital time capsule and considering the idea that my digital footprint and current interests will shift over time and reflect a much different person in 5-10 years from now.
